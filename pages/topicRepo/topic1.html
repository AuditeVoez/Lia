                        Say I'm a student working on my Mathematics in the
                        Modern World project. In my laptop, I search up a
                        statistics set and begin my search for datasets that I
                        need to analyze. Going onto reputable
                        sites, I would be presented by raw data. To me, these
                        would be numbers that are purely statistical and have no
                        direct meaning to me yet. <br><br>
                        I would then start to interpret that data, using
                        mathematical formulas and logical connections to turn
                        that data into information. Information is basically raw
                        data processed and turned into something more useable.
                        It's kind of like
                        making food, where data feels like raw meat, and by
                        cooking (processing)
                        it, you get something edible (information). After I
                        process the data, there's one more step I need to take.
                        Just like cooking meat, it won't be complete unless I
                        personalize it, and in this case, I will be turning the
                        information into knowledge.
                        <br><br>
                        Knowledge, as defined, is information you personalize
                        and process individually.
